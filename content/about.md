# About

Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I am **Sachin Maurya** a final year student at [Xavier Institute of Engineering](https://www.xavier.ac.in/) majoring in Information Technology and currently, I'm working as a Technical writer Intern at [CloudYuga](https://cloudyuga.guru/explore).

I have always been passionate about computers, software programming, and technology as a whole. The thrill of building something I envisioned in my mind and watching it work is something Iâ€™ve always been a fan of. Recently, I have been obsessed with how important it is for technology to be used in an ethically right way. Security of systems, user privacy, and ethical use of data are the areas that excite me the most. Currently, I'm learning about **Kubernetes** and learning new things about it every day. I have also found interest in other **CNCF tech**  and looking to learn more about it. As most of the project is in **Go** programming language I have started loving this language.

Apart from my work and academic, I'm a fitness freak my morning start with my **calisthenics** workout and I also love reading novels. Some of my favorites are by *Haruki Murakami* named *Kafka on the shore* & *Norwegian wood* and many others...

This website is supposed to be a portfolio for all my work and will be updated as I progress in my career.
